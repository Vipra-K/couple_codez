Universal Patient Record Management System (UPRMS)

Overview:
The Universal Patient Record Management System is a secure digital platform that stores and manages a patient’s complete medical history in one place. The system is designed to give patients full visibility and control over their health records while allowing hospitals and healthcare providers to upload verified medical data.

Core Principle:
The patient is the owner of the medical data. Hospitals and healthcare providers can upload records, but they cannot modify or delete existing data once uploaded. Patients can view, download, and share access to their records but cannot alter medical information.

Key Roles:
1. Patient
2. Hospital / Healthcare Provider
3. Doctor / Authorized Medical Staff
4. System Administrator

Patient Capabilities:
- View all medical records linked to their profile
- Download reports such as lab results, prescriptions, and discharge summaries
- Share records with doctors or hospitals using consent-based access
- Grant time-limited or purpose-specific access
- Revoke access at any time
- Track access history through audit logs

Hospital and Healthcare Provider Capabilities:
- Upload medical records such as test results, diagnosis summaries, prescriptions, and imaging reports
- Upload data only after patient identity verification
- Cannot edit or delete previously uploaded records
- Access patient data only with patient consent, unless emergency access is enabled

Doctor Access:
- Doctors can view patient records only when explicit consent is granted
- Access may be limited to a specific duration or specific data types
- All access actions are logged for transparency and accountability

Data Types Stored:
- Personal health identifiers
- Lab test reports
- Prescriptions
- Diagnosis summaries
- Imaging references (X-ray, CT, MRI links)
- Vaccination records
- Discharge summaries
- Treatment history

Security and Privacy:
- All data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- Role-based access control is enforced
- Consent-based access ensures patient privacy
- Every access and modification attempt is logged
- Unauthorized access attempts are blocked and recorded

Emergency Access (Break-Glass Mechanism):
- In critical situations, emergency access may be granted without prior consent
- Emergency access is time-limited and highly restricted
- Every emergency access event is logged and visible to the patient

System Objectives:
- Reduce duplicate medical tests
- Improve continuity of care across hospitals
- Enable faster and more accurate diagnosis
- Provide secure and lifelong access to medical history
- Improve healthcare efficiency and reduce costs

AI Chatbot Responsibilities:
- Help patients understand their medical records
- Explain medical terms in simple language
- Guide patients on how to upload, view, or share records
- Assist doctors in quickly summarizing patient history
- Answer system-related questions such as access rules and privacy policies
- Never provide medical diagnosis or treatment advice

AI Limitations:
- The chatbot does not diagnose diseases
- The chatbot does not modify patient records
- The chatbot does not replace a licensed medical professional
- The chatbot provides informational assistance only

Compliance and Standards:
- Designed to align with modern healthcare data interoperability standards
- Supports structured and unstructured medical data formats
- Maintains audit trails for regulatory and legal compliance

User Guidance:
Patients should consult certified healthcare professionals for diagnosis and treatment decisions. The system is intended to support healthcare delivery, not replace medical judgment.
